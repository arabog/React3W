/*
Hooks allow us to "hook" into React features such as 
state and lifecycle methods.

You must import Hooks from react.
Here we are using the useState Hook to keep track of 
the application state.
State generally refers to application data or properties 
that need to be tracked.


Hook Rules
There are 3 rules for hooks:
Hooks can only be called inside React function components.
Hooks can only be called at the top level of a component.
Hooks cannot be conditional
